Availability Estimate
Write a paragraph or two describing the achievable Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO) for this Multi-AZ, multi-region database in terms of:


00 - 05: RTO for a single AZ outage = 5 mins (if the fault was detected 5imns after)
05 - 06: Time to restore = 6 mins (one or two mins to restore from last backup)
06 - 36: The minimum RPO for a single AZ is 30 minutes (backup latest restore time)
36 - 37: RPO for a Single region is one minute (1 min) for a month and none within a month.
For a Single AZ, 36-37 mins.

00 - 05: RTO for a Multi AZs outage
05 - 06: Time to restore (one min to restore to latest backup )
06 - 06: RPO for a single failure is None
Multi-AZs has avaliability equivalent to 99.5%-99.9%
